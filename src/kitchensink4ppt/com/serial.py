"""Process-wide COM serialization (ported from KS4W, 2026-09-04).

The Word live COM stress test (three agents, one open document) proved that
unserialized concurrent COM access produces character-level interleaved
writes, modal-dialog deadlocks on the save temp-file swap, and unbounded
hangs. PowerPoint inherits every one of those failure modes and adds one
of its own: POWERPNT is a STRICT SINGLETON COM server. Word hands out a
private invisible instance per DispatchEx; PowerPoint does not. Every COM
path in this server therefore converges on ONE PowerPoint process, so
there is no per-instance isolation to fall back on and serialization is
not a mitigation here, it is the only thing standing between two
concurrent tool calls and a shared mutable application object.

Coverage contract: every COM entry point acquires the lock —
- the live layer (live.live_session wraps every live tool; live_status
  uses the bounded try-acquire form),
- the bridge layer (every public invisible-instance function, enforced by
  test_com_serialization's audit of the _com_serialized marker).

The lock is an RLock: nested acquisitions on one thread are legal (a
bridge helper called under an already-held lock must not deadlock).

Scope honesty: the lock serializes THIS server process. Two separate
kitchensink4ppt processes automating the same PowerPoint are not
serialized, and on a singleton that is a real hole (each MCP client
normally spawns its own server, so the covered case is the reported one:
several agents of ONE session sharing one server). Status reporting
(lock_snapshot) lets powerpoint_status and live_status tell callers
honestly when a call would queue.
